# ðŸŽ‰ NookureStaff is Now Free on Modrinth! ðŸŽ‰

Weâ€™re excited to announce that **NookureStaff** is now available for free on Modrinth! You can download it here: [NookureStaff on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/staff).

This change comes as a result of legal reasons related to the pluginâ€™s revenue generation. Currently, Iâ€™m unable to monetize NookureStaff, so Iâ€™ve decided to make it free for everyone. While NookureStaff no longer generates revenue, contributions are warmly welcomed on our GitHub repository: [NookureStaff GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Nookure/NookureStaff).

I truly appreciate your early support in purchasing the plugin before this change. Your contributions helped maintain and improve the plugin up to this point, and Iâ€™m deeply grateful for that. I want to assure you that this isnâ€™t the endâ€”there may be a possibility in the future where a premium addon is released for NookureStaff. If that happens, I will make sure that previous buyers will receive it for free.

We understand that this change may raise some concerns. Would you prefer an alternative scenario where the plugin was discontinued and abandoned, or one where it evolves into a community-driven project? We believe the latter ensures NookureStaff remains valuable to everyone in the long term.

Thank you for your continued support, and we hope youâ€™ll continue to enjoy NookureStaff in the future!
